## Can I invite this bot to my server?
No. Lectern is not a public bot, and it contains code that assumes the bot is only present in one server. The main reason the code is open source is to allow anyone in the DarkHorse community to help improve the bot. Hosting your own copy of the bot is not supported. If you decide to adapt any of the code for your own purposes, please respect the [license](https://github.com/pfist/lectern/blob/master/LICENSE).
